# StringRepeater
Just enter a string, choose a file,  choose how many times you want it to repeat, and press Repeat! The custom increment option changes the increment, for example, if the number 
of times I want it to repeat are 20, but my increment is 2, it will only repeat for 10 times as the increment value is added 2 each time. Feel free to look into the code,
it's quite simple.  It was made using c#
